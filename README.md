# PunchLine

For this assignment, you will create a program that reads and prints a joke and its punch line from two different files. The first file contains a joke but not its punch line. The second file has the punch line as its last line, preceded by “garbage.” You can pick the joke and the punchline, but please make sure the joke is not inappropriate or offensive in nature. The main function of your program should open the two files and then call two functions, passing each one the file it needs. The first function should read and display each line in the file it is passed (the joke file). The second function should display only the last line of the file it is passed (the punch line file). It should find this line by seeking to the end of the file and then backing up to the beginning of the last line. You must create all files for this program. Be sure to include comments throughout your code where appropriate. Make sure that your comments thoroughly explain the stream input/output and what is happening in your program.
